*The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others. We need to identify the people who were morelikly to survive based on the data provided *

<h3><u><i>Project Objective:</h3></u></i><br>
This Project is purely for learning purpose and can be used as a tutorial to learn for a Data Science student. I will be more than happy if someone will learn something from this project.

<h3>Dataset columns information </h3>
<i>
    <ol>
        <li><b>PassengerId:</b> Unique ID of every passanger</li>
        <li><b>Survived:</b> This is the target variable having 0 or 1. 1 means Passanger has Survived 0 means Not Survived </li>
        <li><b>Pclass:</b> Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)</li>
        <li><b>Name:</b> Passenger Name</li>
        <li><b>Sex:</b> Male or Female</li>
        <li><b>Age: </b>Passenger's Age</li>
        <li><b>SibSp:</b># of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic</li>
        <li><b>Parch: </b># of parents / children aboard the Titanic</li>
        <li><b>Ticket:</b>Ticket Number</li>
        <li><b>Fare:</b> Passenger Fare</li>
        <li><b>Cabin:</b>Cabin number</li>
        <li><b>Embarked:</b>Port of Embarkation(C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)(From Where did Passenger Boarded)</li>
    </ol>

<h3>Learnings & Conclusion</h3>
<ul>
   <li>If you are having small dataset,use cross Fold.You shouldn't split the data into train and test,else model learning will be impacted inversely</li> 
    <li>You always have to take care of Data Leakage</li>
    <li>Feature Engineering is the most important step followed by Model Tuning</li>
    <li>It would be very helpful if you are having domain knowledge.So you can perform Feature Engineering in much better way</li>
</ul>
